                <p>Former Park City Mayor <span class="bold">Dana Williams</span> on Tuesday started a campaign to reclaim the position, adding another formidable candidate to what could be a crowded contest for City Hall's highest office.</p>

                <p>Williams served three terms as the mayor, ending in early 2014 and covering 12 years that stretched through the 2002 Winter Olympics, the post-Games economic boom and then the recession. He won the 2001, 2005 and 2009 mayoral campaigns by significant margins, including an uncontested re-election in 2005. He did not seek a fourth term in 2013 and owns a home-improvement business.</p>

                <p>Williams, 62 and a Prospector resident who has lived in Park City since 1990 and Summit County since 1978, rose to prominence as the leader of an influential development watchdog before winning the mayor's office in his first-ever political campaign. In the three-plus years since he left office, Williams has pressed several issues at City Hall but has largely remained out of politics. He was notably involved in the dispute regarding Vail Resorts' bid to trademark the name 'Park City' as it applies to a mountain resort. Williams was among the leaders of the opposition movement to the trademark. He also monitored the Mountain Accord efforts meant to craft a long-range vision for the Wasatch Mountain region.</p>
